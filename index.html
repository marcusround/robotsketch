    <p>Inspired to improve on this idea in the document:</p>
    <img src="algo.png" />
    <p>This felt very dry, like a test, and I wanted to explore something more gamelike.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the concept of a surgical robot, and intended to teach algorithmic thinking.</p>
    <p>The game concept could be to perform simplified surgery - basketball was easier for me to prototype.</p>
    <p>To reinforce algorithmic thinking, player could be required to queue up commands, rather than activate them
      immediately.</p>
    <p>This is very very simple and messy prototype to sketch out an idea, thrown together over two days.</p>
    <p>Further
      development would start from scratch with a more refined design and improved graphics.</p>
    <p>Try to sink a basket!</p>
