    <p>Inspired to improve this idea in the document:</p>
    <img src="algo.png" />
    <p>Intended to be a simple game to teach algorithmic thinking.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the concept of a surgical robot.</p>
    <p>The game concept could be to perform simplified knee surgery - basketball was quicker for me to
      prototype.</p>
    <p>To reinforce algorithmic thinking, player could be required to queue up commands, rather than activate them
      immediately.</p>
    <p>This is very very simple and messy prototype to sketch out an idea, thrown together in two days. Code would
      be thrown out and development started from scratch with a more refined design and improved graphics.</p>
    <p>Try to sink a basket!</p>
